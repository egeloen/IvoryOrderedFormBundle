[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/egeloen/IvoryOrderedFormBundle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/egeloen/IvoryOrderedFormBundle)

The bundle allows to order your Symfony2 form fields by adding the position option. A position can either be first,
last or an associative array describing before and/or after field.

## Documentation

 2. [Usage](http://github.com/egeloen/IvoryOrderedFormBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/usage.md)

## Known limitations

 * The orderer does not support symetric before/after options.
 * The orderer does not support before & after option simultaneously to move other field(s).

There are probably other limitations, if you find one, report it!
